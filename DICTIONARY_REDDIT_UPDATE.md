# Dictionary System - Reddit Support Added

## âœ… **Reddit Integration Complete!**

Reddit has been added as a supported source for custom dictionaries. Users can now create dictionaries with subreddit names and assign them to Reddit for more targeted content.

### ðŸŽ¯ **How Reddit Dictionary Works:**

1. **Create Subreddit Dictionary:**
   ```
   /dictionary create name:"Anime Subreddits" description:"Subreddits for anime content"
   ```

2. **Add Subreddit Names:**
   ```
   /dictionary edit <id>
   ```
   Add subreddits like: `anime, manga, animemes, wholesomeanimemes, animegifs`

3. **Assign to Reddit:**
   ```
   /settings assign source:reddit dictionary:<id>
   ```

4. **Result:** When Reddit provider needs a subreddit, it will use your custom list instead of the default subreddit list!

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**
