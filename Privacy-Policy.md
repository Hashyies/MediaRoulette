This Privacy Policy describes how Media Roulette ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you interact with our Discord bot (the "Bot"). By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect several types of information to provide and improve our service to you.

### 1.1. Information You Provide Directly

*   **Discord User ID:** We use your Discord User ID as a unique identifier to create and manage your user profile within the Bot.
*   **Commands and Content:** We process the commands you use and any content you provide within those commands, such as text for searches or custom subreddit names.

    *   **Source and Command Usage:** We track how many times you use each command and each media source (e.g., Reddit, Imgur).

### 1.3. Information Related to Specific Features

*   **Giveaways:** If you participate in a giveaway, your Discord User ID is stored in a list of entries. If you host a giveaway, your User ID is stored as the host. The winner's User ID is also recorded.

### 1.4. Anonymized and Aggregated Data

For statistical analysis and service improvement, we collect and store aggregated, anonymized data. This data is not personally identifiable and is used to understand trends. This includes:
*   Hourly counts of commands used, images generated, active users, and new users.
*   Hourly usage statistics for different media sources, commands, and themes.
*   Hourly totals for economic activity (coins earned/spent, quests completed).
*   Overall totals for the number of users and images generated across the entire Bot.

This aggregated data is stored in CSV files in a `stats` directory and does not contain individual User IDs.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the Bot:** Your User ID and associated data are essential for the Bot's core functionality, such as saving your progress, maintaining your settings, and delivering a personalized experience.
*   **To Personalize Your Experience:** We use your theme, locale, and custom query history to tailor the Bot's appearance and functionality to your preferences.
*   **To Manage the In-Bot Economy:** Your coin balance, transaction history, and inventory are used to operate the Bot's economic and gameplay features.
*   **To Improve the Bot:** We analyze aggregated and anonymized usage statistics to identify popular features, diagnose problems, and make informed decisions about future development.
*   **To Provide Support:** If you require assistance, we may access your user data to troubleshoot issues you are experiencing.
*   **To Ensure Security and Compliance:** We may use data to enforce our Terms of Service, prevent abuse, and ensure the security of our services.

*   **With Your Consent:** We may share your information if you give us explicit permission to do so.
*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).

Upon receiving a deletion request, we will erase all personally identifiable information associated with your Discord User ID from our database, including your user profile, settings, economy data, usage statistics, and user-generated content.
