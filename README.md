# MediaRoullete

MediaRoullete is a media discord bot that allows users to test their luck, whether they get cute cats messing around, some spicy pictures, or content that'll make them look away from internet for good.

### Why though?
I just happened to have this idea of letting users classify images as NSFW and not, and these are stored for use in other projects I will create.

### Which sites are currently supported?
- 4Chan
- PicSum
- Imgur
- Reddit (Subreddit dictionary needs to be higher)

### Roadmap
<details><summary><strong>Completed Tasks</strong></summary>

- [x] ~~Discord bot for receiving images~~
- [x] ~~Adding a variety of popular subreddits~~
- [x] ~~Create probability table for RandomImage for integration with other parts of the project~~
- [x] ~~Create a webhook/database system for receiving NSFW rating and storing them.~~
- [x] Allow users to use their own Reddit API keys. (May be discarded for now)

</details>

**Ongoing tasks**

- [ ] Add "Search for Image" feature where users will find an image
- [ ] Allow code to only run in NSFW channels to follow Discord Terms of Service.


### Donate?
All this work is done in my free-time alongside my studies as a hobby, though getting donations would encourage me to keep working on open-source projects for everyone to see! 

Even if you cannot donate, **I would appreciate if you could star this project** â™¡
