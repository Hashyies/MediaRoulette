# MediaRoullete

MediaRoullete is a media discord bot that allows users to test their luck, whether they get cute cats messing around, some spicy pictures, or content that'll make them look away from internet for good.

### Why though?
I just happened to have this idea of letting users classify images as NSFW and not, and these are stored for use in other projects I will create.

### Which sites are currently supported?
- 4Chan
- PicSum
- Imgur
- Reddit (Subreddit dictionary needs to be higher)

### Roadmap
**Ongoing tasks**

- [ ] Allow code to only run in NSFW channels to follow Discord Terms of Service.
- [ ] Think of more ideas meanwhile to add here
- [ ] Investigate DeviantArt (Possible, but needs a dictionary like reddit for gallaries)
- [ ] Try to add rigged twitter

<details><summary><strong>Completed Tasks</strong></summary>

- [x] ~~Discord bot for receiving images~~

- [x] Add "Search for Image" feature where users will find an image

### How to build
1. Download a release or login to github and download one of the developer releases from [Github Actions](https://github.com/Hashyies/MediaRoulette/actions)
2. Rename the extension from jar to zip then extract it
3. Rename/edit the .env in resources according to your details
4. Compress the files as a zip and then rename the extension to .jar again

### Donate?
All this work is done in my free-time alongside my studies as a hobby, though getting donations would encourage me to keep working on open-source projects for everyone to see! 

Even if you cannot donate, **I would appreciate if you could star this project** â™¡
