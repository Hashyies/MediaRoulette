# MediaRoullete

MediaRoullete is a media discord bot that allows users to test their luck, whether they get cute cats messing around, some spicy pictures, or content that'll make them look away from internet for good.

### Why though?
I just happened to have this idea of letting users classify images as NSFW and not, and these are stored for use in other projects I will create.

### Which sites are currently supported?
- 4Chan
- PicSum
- Imgur
- Reddit (Subreddit dictionary needs to be larger)
- Rule34xxx
- Tenor (v1 API had random but not v2, therefore needs a dictionary ASAP!!!!!!)
- Movies (TMDB)
- TV Shows (TMDB)
- Youtube Videos
- Youtube Shorts
- Urban Dictionary

### Roadmap
**Ongoing tasks**

- [ ] Allow code to only run in NSFW channels to follow Discord Terms of Service.
- [ ] Think of more ideas meanwhile to add here
- [ ] Investigate DeviantArt (Possible, but needs a dictionary like reddit for gallaries)
- [ ] Try to add rigged Twitter

<details><summary><strong>Completed Tasks</strong></summary>

- [x] ~~Discord bot for receiving images~~
- [x] ~~Adding a variety of popular subreddits~~
- [x] ~~Create probability table for RandomImage for integration with other parts of the project~~
- [x] ~~Create a webhook/database system for receiving NSFW rating and storing them.~~
- [x] ~~Allow users to use their own Reddit API keys. (May be discarded for now)~~
- [x] ~~Add "Search for Image" feature where users will find an image~~

### Contributing
If you would like to support this project with your programming knowledge, please do! I am not professional by any means. I need help with expanidng the dictionaries and with code management as this coding style adapted at the moment is not efficient and uses functional style programming on an OOP language, which doesn't make sense. As time goes on and my skills improve, so will the codebase, I have already rewritten many methods or classes numerous times for efficiency purposes, in order to fully run this bot one day with high reliability. A known issue at the moment is with Imgur, which I am investigating using JSoup to stop invalid Imgur sites making it into the users' side.

### How to build
1. Download a release or login to github and download one of the developer releases from [Github Actions](https://github.com/Hashyies/MediaRoulette/actions)
2. Rename the extension from jar to zip then extract it
3. Rename/edit the .env in resources according to your details
4. Compress the files as a zip and then rename the extension to .jar again

### Donate?
All this work is done in my free-time alongside my studies as a hobby, though getting donations would encourage me to keep working on open-source projects for everyone to see! 

Even if you cannot donate, **I would appreciate if you could star this project** â™¡
